* While giving input, the operands must be given first, followed by the operator. For example: 2 3 +
* If insufficient parameters are given or if the order of inputs is different, then an error message gets printed, saying that there are insufficient parameters.

* Division by zero is not allowed and hence an error message gets printed, followed by adding zero to the stack.
